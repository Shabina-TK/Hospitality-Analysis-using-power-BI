AtliQ Hospitality Analysis
 
 AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the 
hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other 
competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are 
losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a 
strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate 
“Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and 
revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide 
them with these insights.
 • Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider 
to provide them insights from their historical data
